    The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among Americaâ€™s most popular dog breeds. <br>
    They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.
